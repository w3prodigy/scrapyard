This repository contains a collection of notable code I've written in my career as a LAMP Developer since the year 2000.

This code has not been updated since it was originally authored. My skills and knowledge of Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML are being improved constantly.

## Javascript Samples
There are 3 pieces of code in the `Javascript-Samples` directory designed to accomplish the following:

* Get rid of the iPhone web browser's toolbar.
* Detect the iPhone's orientation from it's web browser.
* Slide content in the web browser similarly to the iPhones native experience.

## PHP Samples
There are 3 pieces of code in the `PHP-Samples` directory designed to accomplish te following:

* Force downloads upon user request.
* Map form fields to database fields.
* Process large datasets using PHP's process handling.

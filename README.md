This repository contains a collection of notable code I've written in my career as a LAMP Developer since the year 2000.

This code has not been updated since it was originally authored. My skills and knowledge of Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Javascript, jQuery, CSS and HTML are being improved constantly.

## Javascript Samples
During my time working for Mindcomet, a closed interactive marketing business, between 2007 and 2008 one of the projects I worked on was the iPhone Minds project. The iPhone had just been released by Apple and the web development industry needed solutions to accomodate this new mobile territory. The iPhone Minds blog offered some of the first solutions to mobile web development.

There are 3 pieces of code in the `Javascript-Samples` directory designed to accomplish the following:
1. Get rid of the iPhone web browser's toolbar.
2. Detect the iPhone's orientation from it's web browser.
3. Slide content in the web browser similarly to the iPhones native experience.

## PHP Samples
I was first introduced to PHP in 2000 by a high school classmate and it became my go-to language for web development and coding in general. I've written several pieces of code since then that I'm really proud of - maybe not the formatting anymore but you get what I mean.

There are 3 pieces of code in the `PHP-Samples` directory designed to accomplish te following:
1. Force downloads upon user request.
2. Map form fields to database fields.
3. Process large datasets using PHP's process handling.
